# Retrieval-Aware Hallucination Detection with Direct Density-Ratio Estimation

Research code for an in-progress paper extending Wang et al., **“Hallucination Detection for Generative Large Language Models by Bayesian Sequential Estimation” (EMNLP 2023)**.

## Research objective

The objective is to develop a retrieval-aware hallucination-detection framework that **reduces computational overhead while improving factuality-detection performance** relative to Bayesian sequential estimation (BSE). The application motivation is reliable, lower-latency LLM-based enterprise customer-service systems.

## Research question

**Can retrieval-aware direct density-ratio estimation reduce the computational cost of hallucination detection while improving factuality-detection performance compared with Bayesian sequential estimation?**

## Controlled comparison

The proposed method does **not** receive easier evidence than the BSE baseline. Both methods use the same released experimental pipeline from Wang et al.:

1. SelfCheckGPT generated sentences and human factuality labels;
2. Wang et al.'s released decomposed subclaims;
3. Wang et al.'s ordered retrieved web documents for each subclaim;
4. the same DeBERTa-v3 NLI model and document-entailment scoring rule;
5. the same separate positive/negative NBC evidence pairs used by the published baseline.

The comparison changes only the **statistical evidence-accumulation / stopping mechanism**.

The Wang artifacts are pinned to source commit `3e8fc4d69fbff2c9060bdbb347f2bd94847f75ea` for reproducibility.

## Published BSE baselines

Two BSE variants are retained deliberately:

- **`bse_official`** reproduces the behavior of the authors' released GitHub implementation, including its one-step look-ahead calculation.
- **`bse_equation8`** implements Equation 8 from the EMNLP paper literally by weighting next-step stop risk by the predictive probability of each entailment-feature bin.

This distinction matters because the released code and the written Equation 8 are not mathematically identical. We do not silently replace the published implementation with our preferred interpretation.

The BSE setup follows the published defaults used in the released `run.sh`:

- `P0 = 0.5`
- `C_M = 28`
- `C_FA = 96`
- `C_retrieve = 1`
- maximum retrieved documents per subclaim: `K = 10`
- document segmentation: 400 words with 100-word overlap
- NBC samples: 200 factual + 200 nonfactual examples

For each external document, DeBERTa scores its text spans and the document score is the **maximum entailment score across spans**, matching Wang et al. The code also preserves the two slightly different discretization formulas used in the authors' released `NBC_feature.py` and `main.py`.

## Proposed method: uLSIF DDRE

The proposed method now uses a genuine **Direct Density Ratio Estimator**, not a classifier whose posterior is relabeled as a density ratio.

We use unconstrained Least-Squares Importance Fitting (**uLSIF**) to estimate directly

`r(s) = p(s | factual) / p(s | hallucinated)`

from the continuous DeBERTa entailment scores in the same Wang NBC factual/nonfactual evidence data used by BSE. Kernel width and regularization are selected by deterministic cross-validation using the uLSIF held-out objective.

Unlike BSE, DDRE does not:

- discretize the continuous entailment score into ten bins;
- separately estimate both class-conditional densities; or
- compute a Bayesian expected-risk look-ahead after every retrieved document.

For a sequence of retrieved documents, directly estimated evidence ratios are accumulated in log space. The method stops retrieving evidence when its factuality posterior leaves a validation-selected uncertainty interval. The lower and upper stopping thresholds are selected **only on validation passages**.

## What “improving factuality” means here

This experiment measures **factuality detection**, not generation correction. Therefore, an improvement means that the framework more accurately distinguishes factual from hallucinated generated content. It does not yet prove that the underlying LLM itself generates more factual text. A future end-to-end ECSS experiment can test whether rejecting, correcting, or regenerating detected hallucinations increases factual accuracy delivered to users.

## Primary evaluation

To stay comparable with Wang et al., the experiment reports the same trapezoidal PR-AUC convention used by their released code:

- nonfactual sentence-level AUC-PR;
- factual sentence-level AUC-PR;
- sentence-level accuracy;
- passage-level Pearson correlation;
- passage-level Spearman correlation;
- average retrieved documents per sentence;
- average retrieved documents per subclaim.

We additionally report:

- balanced PR-AUC;
- balanced accuracy;
- macro-F1;
- MCC;
- factual/nonfactual precision, recall, and F1;
- scikit-learn average precision as a secondary PR metric;
- total and average NLI span evaluations;
- wall-clock execution time.

The primary computational-overhead measures are **retrieved external documents** and **NLI span evaluations**, because they are hardware-independent.

### Important retrieval interpretation

The released Wang repository already contains the ordered web pages returned by their original retrieval process. Our experiment consumes those pages sequentially instead of issuing new live Bing searches. Therefore, “retrieved documents” means the number of external documents the decision policy chooses to consume from the released retrieval sequence. This makes BSE and DDRE reproducible on identical evidence. A later deployment experiment should additionally measure live search/network latency.

## Hypothesis test

The generated result file explicitly reports whether the primary hypothesis is supported on the held-out test data. The current predeclared rule requires DDRE to:

1. retrieve fewer documents than `bse_official`;
2. improve factual AUC-PR; and
3. not reduce balanced PR-AUC.

This prevents us from declaring success by selecting only favorable metrics after seeing the test results.

## Data preparation

The large Wang et al. artifacts are not duplicated in this repository. Download the authors' released data with:

```bash
python scripts/prepare_wang_data.py
```

This creates:

```text
data/wang/
  NBC/
  decomposed/
  selfcheckgpt/
  webpage/
```

`data/wang/` is ignored by Git. Please cite Wang et al. and follow the source repository's licensing/citation requirements when using those artifacts.

## Installation

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Core regression tests

Run the fast math/syntax checks before expensive NLI experiments:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

A GitHub Actions workflow also syntax-checks the research pipeline and runs these core tests on changes to `main`.

## Baseline reproduction sanity check

Before interpreting the new method, reproduce the released Wang BSE behavior on the full evidence set:

```bash
python scripts/reproduce_wang_baseline.py
```

This writes:

```text
results/wang_reproduction.json
```

The file stores both our reproduced metrics and the Table 1 reference values for `C_M=14, C_FA=24` and `C_M=28, C_FA=96`. Differences should be investigated before using DDRE-vs-BSE results in the paper.

## Smoke test

After preparing the Wang data:

```bash
python main.py --smoke-test
```

Smoke-test artifacts are debugging-only and ignored by Git. **Do not use them in the paper.** If the official large model is too slow for a pure code-path check, a smaller model can be supplied explicitly, but those numbers remain debugging-only.

## Full paper experiment

```bash
python main.py
```

The full experiment writes:

```text
results/latest_summary.json
results/latest_predictions.csv
results/latest_ddre_model.json
```

By default, a successful full run automatically commits and pushes **only these three result artifacts** to the current GitHub branch. Raw Wang data and the NLI cache are never added. To disable automatic result pushing:

```bash
python main.py --no-push-results
```

## Persistent NLI cache

NLI scoring is expensive. Deterministic claim/span entailment scores are cached locally in:

```text
results/wang_nli_cache.sqlite
```

The cache is ignored by Git and reused across BSE/DDRE runs. Delete and rebuild it only when intentionally changing the NLI scoring protocol:

```bash
python main.py --rebuild-cache
```

For a hardware-dependent uncached timing run:

```bash
python main.py --live-inference --no-push-results
```

## Model fidelity and development speed

The default model matches the Wang et al. released implementation:

```text
MoritzLaurer/DeBERTa-v3-large-mnli-fever-anli-ling-wanli
```

For debugging only, a smaller compatible model may be passed with `--model-name`, but **paper results should use the official large model unless the experimental protocol is intentionally changed and reported**.

## Research status

This is active research code. Numerical claims for the paper abstract should come only from a successful Wang-aligned full experiment and should be reported even if the DDRE hypothesis is not supported.
